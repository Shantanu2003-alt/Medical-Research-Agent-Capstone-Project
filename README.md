# Medical-Research-Agent
An AI-powered Medical Research Agent that turns complex medical text into clear insights. It extracts symptoms, causes and treatments and gives accurate medical definitions using RAG.

The agent produces easy-to-understand and structured outputs for research use and for communication with patients.

# Features to be covered in this project:

Prompting (4+ different types)

Structured Output (Pydantic models)

Semantic Search (Tavily + Wikipedia)

RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation)

Tool Calling (Multiple APIs)

LangGraph (2 complex graphs, 8+ nodes, conditional edges)

# Steps followed in this project:

Step 1: Environment Setup

Step 2: Data Models

Step 3: Text Summarization Node

Step 4: Information Extraction Node

Step 5: Retrieval Node (RAG)

Step 6: Structured Output Generator

Step 7: Workflow Graph (LangGraph)

Step 8: Helper Functions

Step 9: End-to-End Workflow Testing

Step 10: Interface / API Integration

Step 11: Final Documentation and Integration with Word Document

Step 12: Final Testing & Debugging

# Reason for Picking Up This Project

This project consists of the concepts that were covered in the course MAT496 taught by Ajit Sir. 
So I have used the concepts like prompting, structured output, semantic search, RAG and tool-calling to build this multi-step automated agent. 
The node-based workflow of Langraph is ideal for chaining tasks like summarization, extraction, retrieval and structured generation.

On a personal level, I have often struggled to understand complex medical terms and it takes me time to search about that from various websites, so I thought that this project would help in that sense as well.
The medical text analysis requires deep reading, research and information organization, so this domain shows how the techniques learned in this course can be used to solve real-world problems that feel time-consuming and difficult.
